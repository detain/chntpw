If you want to build yourself, it should compile
with most gcc compilers. However, I am not particulary good
with types, so there may be some warnings.

You may have to install the openssl-devel package from you
linux distro to compile/link, since I need the static variant.
(change the makefile to link dynamic if you wish)
I link statically with libcrypto.a from OpenSSL.


Thanks to Denis Ducamp for modifying chntpw to use OpenSSL.

If make goes well, you should have a single binary
called 'chntpw', dynamically linked with the clib,
statically with the ssl library.

Also, the floppies and CDs are build under a different
environment for small libc size (uClibc), see website
for details.

So, note that the binary then contains cryptographic code
which may be illegal for you to export.

Good luck.
